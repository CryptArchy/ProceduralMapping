# Procedural Mapping

This is an old project from years ago that probably doesn't work anymore, but I'm uploading it for posterity. The code is all based on Jamis Buck's mazes blog posts, which are now a book! Check them out!

I make no ownership claims except for the code that I actually wrote. There's probably a few snippets here and there copy-pasted from others without attribution, but this was all just for learning purposes, nothing commercially releasable here.
